# m-mail (Alpha version)

## Introduction

m-mail is havily inspired from [Gomail](https://github.com/go-gomail/gomail). I really tried to
build over what the author of gomail did with little more structured codebase.

m-mail can be used to send emails using an SMTP server or with API server (having support for some
popular email vendors.)

This repository is tested with Go 1.6
